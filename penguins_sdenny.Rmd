```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in the penguins.csv data

Packages: tidyverse, car, onewaytests

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(onewaytests)
penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")
```

Our question: Is there a significant difference in mean flipper lengths for female chinstrap, gentoo, and adelie penguins near Palmer Archipelago?

Maybe I can use a one-way ANOVA... but there are assumptions tied to that:
-Independent observations
-Equal variance (Leven's test)
-Normality (histograms/qqplots)

```{r}
counts <- with(penguins, table(Species, Sex))



```
